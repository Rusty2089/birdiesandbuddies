			<div class="card-body">
				<h5>Rules:</h5>
				<p>
				<ol>
				    <li>You get 2 tee shots off the 1st tee.  No mulligans the rest of the round.</li>
					<li>All out of bounds will be played as a lateral hazard.  That means you get to drop a ball lateral to where your ball crossed the hazard taking a 1 stroke penalty.</li>
					<li>Putts inside the length of the putter are considered “gimmies”, but must be conceded by the group.</li>
					<li>All putts for birdie or better must be putted out.</li>
					<li>To qualify for the closest to the pin contest, your ball must be on the green.</li>
					<li>To qualify for the longest drive, your ball must be in the fairway.</li>
					<li>To qualify for the sexiest player in tourney, you must have red hair.</li>
				</ol>
				
				
				
				<h5>Scoring:</h5>
				<p><b>All scoring is individual.</b>  There are random teams that are drawn, but don't tell someone you are on their team, because frankly, you suck and it would ruin their weekend.</p>
				<p>Scoring is based on a points system where you can earn points for each hole based on your score versus par.  In this case, <b>high scores are good.</b>  Points for each hole are earned as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Bogey = 1 point</li>
					<li>Par = 2 points</li>
					<li>Birdie = 4 points</li>
					<li>Eagle = 8 points</li>
					<li>Double Eagle = 10 points</li>					
				</ul>
				<p><b>Your score for each round is the total points you score for that round minus your quota (handicap) for that round.</b>  For example, if you start the round with a quota of 10 and score 12 points, you are +2 for that round and those 2 points are added to your overall tournament score (that’s a good thing!).</p>
				<p><b>Your quota for the next round is adjusted by averaging the previous round’s score with the previous round’s quota.</b>  In the example above where someone starts with a quota and of 10 and scores 12 points, the quota for the next round is 11.  If the average ends in 0.5, the quota is rounded up.</p>
				<p><b>New as of 2019, </b>if a quota adjust to a 25 or more, we are going to cap an adjustment up by 2 points.  So if you start with a 26 and shoot a 32, your next day's quota will be 28 instaed of 29.  Yeah, this applies to maybe two people... and you still get screwed because you're actually good at golfing.</p>
